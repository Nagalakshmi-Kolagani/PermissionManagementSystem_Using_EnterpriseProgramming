# Permission Management System  Using Enterprise Programming

Now-a-days in digital world every thing was online though it is from food ordering to international video calls. Our project is a easy approach for good administration. And easy online transisions. 

Permission Approval System is the process of making Permissions online. Employees of a company can access Permission approval system portal to raise a request for permission with unique ID and will submit it to a leader of employees. Leader will decide if the permission is to be granted. When a leader rejects the permission, a message is to be displayed in employee dashboard when employee logins. If the leader approves the letter it will be forwarded to Manager with unique ID generated at the time of raising the permission. Either manager approves or rejects, the response will be displayed on the dashboards of both leader and employee.
